## Data Structures & Algorithms (Python)

This is a collection of all the popular DSA topics along with the implementations and some common problems.

Credits to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">Geeks for Geeks</a> and Sandeep Jain's self paced DSA course.

I have put this repo with testing and everything so that you can get a hang of how the tests are actually run when you submit your questions on LeetCode or GFG.

### To get started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following commands
   Run

```BASH
# Install dependencies
$ poetry install
# Activate virtual environment
$ poetry shell
# Now you can try running files using
# Replace the {file_name}.py with your actual file name
$ python {file_name}.py
```

3. Running tests

```BASH
$ pytest
```
